Directions for reading the notebook in the cs109_fp/tree/master/process_notebooks folder:

(1) Start with [data_scraping.ipynb](https://github.com/cs109-fp-jcemgz/cs109_fp/blob/master/process_notebooks/data_scraping.ipynb). This notebook outlines out data scraping procedure on the FOMC website and Wikipedia are helpful for understanding how our data is stored.

(2) Continue to [analysis.ipynb](https://github.com/cs109-fp-jcemgz/cs109_fp/blob/master/process_notebooks/analysis.ipynb). This notebook is the main notebook of analysis that we performed for the project. **UPDATE: analysis-copy.ipynb and temp.ipynb are duplicate and should be disregarded.**
